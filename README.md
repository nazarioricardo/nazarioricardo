## A Bit About Me.

```javascript
Boolean(
  "I like programming and making nice things. I used to make a lot of music. Now I play guitar in my spare time. I'm from Puerto Rico, I speak Spanish, English, and I'm trying to learn Portuguese and German. Because why not?"
);
// This will resolve to true, therefore, it is one bit, and it is about me.
```
