It also happens to be the README for my personal website's repository.
**(Currently under construction)**

If you wanna run my site locally (for some reason) skip a bit further down. Otherwise, read a bit about me.

## A Bit About Me.

```javascript
Boolean(
  "I like programming and making nice things. I used to make a lot of music. Now I play guitar in my spare time. I'm from Puerto Rico, I speak Spanish, English, and I'm trying to learn Portuguese and German. Because why not?"
);
// This will resolve to true, therefore, it is one bit, and it is about me.
```

## Running My Website Locally

It's pretty simple really...
It's a Next.js app so just follow these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazarioricardo/nazarioricardo.git
# then
cd nazarioricardo
# now
npm install
# or
yarn install
# and finally
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now you can start editing my page...

Not really sure why you would do that... but sure.
