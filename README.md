You've reached my github page!

It also happens to be the README for my personal website's repository.

If you wanna run my site locally (for some reason) skip a bit further down. Otherwise, read a bit about me.

## A Bit About Me.

You did it! You read a "a bit about me."

I like dumb jokes like that. I also like programming, and making nice things. I'm from Puerto Rico, I speak Spanish, English, and I'm trying to learn Portuguese and German. Because why not?

## Running My Website Locally

It's pretty simple really...
It's a Next.js app so just follow these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazarioricardo/nazarioricardo.git
# then
cd nazarioricardo
# now
npm install
# and finally
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now you can start editing my page...

Not really sure why you would do that... but sure.
